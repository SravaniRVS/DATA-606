The aim of our telco customer churn prediction project using machine learning is to develop a model that can accurately predict which customers are likely to churn, allowing the telco to take proactive measures to retain those customers.

### Introduction

<p align="justify"> 
The telecommunications industry faces a significant challenge in retaining customers, as switching costs for customers are relatively low. In the telecommunications industry, the cost of acquiring a new customer can be up to five times higher than the cost of retaining an existing customer. To address this problem, we propose building a machine learning model that can predict which customers are likely to churn. Identifying those customers can help telcos take proactive measures to retain them.  By doing so, telcos can reduce their customer acquisition costs and increase their customer retention rates, resulting in long-term business success.

  The steps we are going to follow for this project are:
- Data collection
- Data pre-processing
- Data exploration
- Model selection
- Model training
- Model testing and 
- Model evaluation

### Dataset
<p align="justify"> 
We've used open-source IBM Dataset used in telecommunications sector to track customer turnover. It was initially published in the IBM Community and now available on Kaggle website. Source:  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn
The dataset contains 7,043 customers and 21 variables.
